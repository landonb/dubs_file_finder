1. About This Plugin					*dubs-filfndr-about*

This script wraps Command-T so it's available
from <Ctrl-D> and so you can invoke Command-T
without needing to supply any directory paths.

Project page: https://github.com/landonb/dubs_file_finder

Command-T: https://github.com/wincent/Command-T

Install Command-T~
`-----------------`

From the terminal:

   mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/wincent/start
   cd ~/.vim/pack/wincent/start
   git clone https://github.com/wincent/command-t.git
   cd ~/.vim/pack/wincent/start/command-t/ruby/command-t
   sudo apt-get install -y ruby-dev
   ruby extconf.rb
   make

2. File Finder Overview					*dubs-filfndr-overview*

				*<Ctrl-D>* *<C-d>*
<Ctrl-D>		Run `:Command-T` on the `cmdt_paths` directory,
			which contains symlinks to one or more projects
			whose file hierarchies you can fuzzily search
                        to locate and open files.

The short of it~

1. Find the `cmdt_paths` directory in your Vim folder.
| It'll be under `dubs_file_finder`.

2. Populate the directory with symlinks.

3. Press `<Ctrl-D>`.

The long of it~

This script doesn't require you to enter a
target directory when invoking the file finder.
It'll search all the projects linked to from a
special folder.

- The plugin will automatically create the `cmdt_paths`
  directory for you. Check under this project's directory,
  `dubs_file_finder`.

In this manner, it's just one key-combo to invoke Command-T,
and you don't have to specify the directory to scan. You might
be concerned that listing all projects' files together will make
it harder to find the file you want, but Command-T is such a great
tool that even with thousands of source files, it's still a cinch to
find and open files.

You can instead access Command-T directly using
`:CommandT` `{some_dir}`.

Compare to `CtrlP` <https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim>
and `NERDTree` <https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree>,
two other plugins that help you find files.
