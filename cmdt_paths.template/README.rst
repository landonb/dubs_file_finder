This directory is part of Dubs Vim
##################################

Use this directory to store a bunch of symlinks to all the projects
on which you work, and then you can use one Command-T command to
search for any file within all of your projects!

See the command: Ctrl-D.

Note: You might have problems if you use subdirectories in this
directory. So just keep all your links in the same directory as
this README, and then Command-T will see all of your projects.
