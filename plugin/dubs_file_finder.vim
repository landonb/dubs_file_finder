" About:

" Command-T is a great tool for quickly finding and opening
" project files.
"
" This script wraps Command-T so it's available from <Ctrl-D>.
"
" This script doesn't require you to enter a target directory.
" Rather, you'll want to create a ``cmdt_paths`` directory
" somewhere in your Vim folder, and you'll want to populate
" the directory with symlinks to all of your projects.
"
" In this manner, it's just one key-combo to invoke Command-T,
" and you don't have to specify the directory to scan. You might
" be concerned that listing all projects' files together will make
" it harder to find the file you want, but Command-T is such a great
" tool that even with thousands of source files, it's still a cinch to
" find and open files.

" Regarding :set path= and :find
" ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

" Vim has a built-in :find command, but it doesn't implement
" partial or fuzzy finding like Command-T, and it's tedious
" to have to setup 'path' to list all your project directories.
"
" Regardless, here's roughly how it works.
"
" The default path includes the current directory, /usr/include, and
" a trailing comma which also indicates the current directory. E.g.,
"   path=.,/usr/include,,
" Add additional paths to the path for find to search. E.g.,
"   let &path = &path . "," . "/path/to/source/**"
"   ...
" Note that you have to use double-stars to include sub-directories,
" up to 30 levels deep.
" After setting up the path, you can use :find to open files...
" but it's just not as good as Command-T.
" See :h file-searching, :h find, :h args, :h argadd.

" 2017-02-25: Here's a new (to me) one:
"
"   Warning: maximum file limit reached
"
"   Increase it by setting a higher value in $MYVIMRC; eg:
"     let g:CommandTMaxFiles=200000
"   Or suppress this warning by setting:
"     let g:CommandTSuppressMaxFilesWarning=1
"   For best performance, consider using a fast scanner; see:
"     :help g:CommandTFileScanner
"let g:CommandTSuppressMaxFilesWarning=1
let g:CommandTMaxFiles=1000000
" 2017-12-12: We should try git, which runs `ls-files` and falls back to `find`.
" 2018-05-17: Took me long enough! "git" isn't working. Not quite sure why.
"   Well, it seems to work on some symlinks under cmdt_paths/, but not all.
"   Whatever. I don't care too much. Command-T takes a few seconds to load the
"   first time it's run, and I thought maybe git's ls-files would help it run
"   faster; and now I still don't know (well, the "git" option loads Command-T
"   a lot faster than the "find" option, but obviously it's not finding all the
"   same files).
"let g:CommandTFileScanner = "git"

" CtrlP
" ^^^^^

" CtrlP is similar to Command-T. Most people just use one or the other.
" I've included both herein so you can get a taste of both, if you want.

"
" Checkout the source as a git submodule:
"
"  mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/kien/start
"  cd ~/.vim/pack/kien/start
"  git clone https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim.git
"
" Create help docs:
"
" :helptags ~/.vim/pack/kien/start/ctrlp.vim/doc
"
" Restart Vim.
"
" Usage:
" 
"  :CtrlP <some_dir>
"
" NOTE: CtrlP won't find the file from which the command was run,
"       so don't get trapped by searching for the file that's active.
"
" Help:
"
"  :help ctrlp.txt
"  :help ctrlp-options

" Enable CtrlP.
" 2015.01.27: Other code expects first entry of &rtp to be
"             ~/.vim, so use += to append and not ^= to prepend.

" Command-T Compared to (Vs!) CtrlP
" ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

" First impressions: I like Command-T better.
"   1. It includes the active file when searching (otherwise
"      I just get confused!)
"      ([lb] notes this is probably easy to fix in the source,
"       but I don't want to bother finding out; I like Command-T.)
"   2. When first invoked, Command-T shows a big list of alphabatized
"      files (up to the top of your Gvim window) while CtrlP shows just
"      a handful of files and is already applying an algorithm to it
"      so the list looks incomplete.
"   3. The Command-T search algorithm feels more natural, at least
"      for the few things I searched. Even using a contiguous substring
"      of the filename I was looking for, CtrlP didn't always find my
"      file!
"   4. Command-T is compiled... and more processing intense, it seems,
"      but not too bad: it takes a few split seconds to start up on
"      large projects, but that's only the first time you run it after
"      starting Vim or searching a new project. I.e., on subsequent
"      searches, Command-T starts immediately. For this reason, in
"      addition to not wanting to have to change projects all the time,
"      I chose to create the cmdt_paths directory of symlinks.

" One Command-T to Rule Them All
" ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

" DEVs: Populate the cmdt_paths directory with a bunch of symlinks
"       and use Ctrl-E to invoke Command-T. It's a snap!

" Here we override Ctrl-D, because that's a very valuable key combination
" and it's current inhabitant is frittering away its opportunity to be
" useful. Specifically, Ctrl-D is redundant (replaced by more common keys),
" and it's also non-conformist: it performs a different action in different
" modes. Since we intend to use Command-T whenever we feel like it, we'll
" map it to all modes of Ctrl-D.
"
" A little history:
"
"   In Command mode, Ctrl-U and Ctrl-D page up and down, respectively;
"                    Ctrl-E and Ctrl-Y scroll the window up or down one line.
"                    Except in mswin mode, then Ctrl-Y is remapped to Redo.
"
"   In Insert mode, Ctrl-U deletes to beginning of line,
"                   Ctrl-D doesn't seem to do anything?
"                   Ctrl-E copies the character one line beneath the cursor
"                   to the current line, so you can mirror the next line.
"                     EXPLAIN: Where is Ctrl-E mapped or documented?
"                   Ctrl-Y makes my screen blip.
"
"   If you've installed Dubs Vim,
"                   You can scroll the window by one line with <Ctrl-Up/Down>,
"                   and you can page up and down with <PageUp> and <PageDown>.
"
" As you can see, the navigation commands only work in command mode, and
" one of them is already remapped. Also, in insert mode. Ctrl-D doesn't
" seem used. So we might as well map it for both modes to mean Directory
" File Search or something -- just remember, Ctrl-D for directories, i.e.,
" I want to find a file in some directory somewhere.

" We don't require that the cmdt_paths directory be in any one
" particular location, or even that it be so named, so long as
" we can find it amongst your Vim files.
